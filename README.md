# Robotic Arm Kinematics & Path Planning  
**Comprehensive Course Project | Robotics Analysis and Synthesis | [Kennesaw State Universisty]**  

### Overview  
MATLAB-based implementation of forward kinematics, Jacobian analysis, and potential field path planning for a simulated robotic arm. Developed as part of a robotics course to demonstrate core concepts **without relying on pre-built toolbox functions**.

### Key Features 
- **Manual Forward Kinematics Solver**  
  Derives end-effector positions from joint angles for the home position using DH parameters.

### Upcoming (Planned features)
- Jacobian matrix analysis  
- Singularity identification  
- Potential field path planning for obstacle avoidance
